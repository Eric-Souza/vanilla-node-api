# Vanilla NodeJS API

Products API developed using pure NodeJS in order to better understand its core logic. The only dependency used is uuid (random id generator).

## Routing

- GET, POST operations: http://localhost:5000/api/products

- GET, PUT, DELETE operations: http://localhost:5000/api/products/:id
